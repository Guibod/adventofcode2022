https://adventofcode.com/2022/

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

### What is this repository ?

This is Guillaume Boddaert’s repository for this year. I’ll code each days in python, I guess.
